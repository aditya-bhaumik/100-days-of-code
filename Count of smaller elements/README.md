<p>Given an sorted array A of size N. Find number of elements which are less than or equal to given element X.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
  <p><h3>Input:</h3>    N = 6
    A[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10}
    X = 9
    <h3>Output:</h3>5
  </p>
</pre>

<h3>Your Task:</h3>
<p>You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countOfElements() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer X as inputs and returns the number of elements which are less than or equal to given element.</p>
<h3>Expected Time Complexity:</h3>O(N)
<h3>Expected Auxiliary Space:</h3>O(1)
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
<h6>1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup></h6>
<h6>1 <= Ai <= 10<sup>5</sup></h6>
<h6>0 <= X <=10<sup>5</sup></h6>
